Juggluco 8.2.0 and higher contain glucose complications that can be added to existing watch faces:

The watchface contained in Juggluco contained an arrow before the glucose value in the middle of the screen:

Programmed watch faces are not allowed any more in WearOS 5. By putting complications in existing watch faces you can't get an arrow before an glucose value or they become very small. With this new watch face you can get an arrow before a glucose value in a large size. The only short-coming is that there is no indicator of how old the glucose value is, you can only know it by comparing the current time with the time of the glucose value.
